# My Simple PHP Projects

This is a simple repository containing my simple projects done in PHP language.

## What is included in this repo?

Some really simple projects done in PHP language. Mainly GET and POST actions handling and some communication with database (MySQL).
Of course this repo lacks `mysql-connect.php` files from obvious reasons.
However, those files looks like:
```
<?php

$servername="";
$username="";
$password="";
$dbname="";

$conn=new mysqli($servername,$username,$password,$dbname);

mysqli_set_charset($conn,"utf8");

?>
```
